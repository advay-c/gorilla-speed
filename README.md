myp personal project


- My final product for my MYP personal project was a website by the name of Gorilla Speed. Gorilla Speed is aimed to test your typing and clicking speed using a creative and innovative algorithm. For the typing test, a large list of words were taken in and randomised to create a random set of words every time. Once you finish your typing test, the typing speed along with your maximum typing speed are displayed in a window prompt. For the clicking test, you start the test by clicking into the area and start to click as fast as possible. Along with the typing speed test your maximum number of clicks are shown with your current clicks per second, solved using a simple mathematical formula $$CPS  = totalClicks / 10.00$$ $$WPM = timeSpent / 30$$ where 10.00 is the amount of time given and 30 is the amount of words typed.
